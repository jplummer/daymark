# Ideas

- ~~Consider https://remixicon.com icons or some other free icon source, provided we can use them in the editor~~ Done — using Remix Icon via npm.
- **Caret-shaped back/forward icons** — Current back/forward icons could be more caret-like. Low priority cosmetic.
- Eventually we will need a settings panel for 
    - syntax highlighting options
    - colors and styling
    - location of notes (see "flexible notes directory" below)
    - sync settings
- simple note + calendar icon for daymark
- not have an icon in the dock for every window
- context menu and command-click to open a link in a new window
- make it clear what's an internal and external link – markdown link for external, double bracket for internal
- **Flexible notes directory** — Long-term, Daymark should be able to point at any folder of markdown files, not just NotePlan's directory. Users should be able to choose `.md` or `.txt` as the file extension (or accept both). For now, targeting NotePlan's exact conventions is the right call, but the architecture should avoid hard-coding assumptions that would make this difficult later.
- **Scheduling convenience shortcuts** — `>tomorrow`, `>Friday`, `>+1d`, `>+3d`, `>+1w`, `>+1m` etc., auto-converted to a concrete `>YYYY-MM-DD` on entry. Lower priority than getting `>today` and `>YYYY-MM-DD` right.
- **Schedule to weekly notes** — NotePlan syntax is `>YYYY-Wnn` (e.g. `>2026-W08`). Useful for "I won't get to this today, put it on next week's plan."
- **Schedule to quarterly notes** — NotePlan syntax is `>YYYY-Qn` (e.g. `>2026-Q1`). Lower priority.
- **Weekly carry-forward (`>thisweek`?)** — No weekly equivalent to `>today` exists in NotePlan. Could be useful for tasks that should roll week-to-week until done, but not yet clear if needed. Someday-maybe.
- **Better numbered lists** — NotePlan handles numbered/ordered lists poorly. Opportunity to do better.
- **Task iconography** — NotePlan's task icons (circle, circle+check, circle+arrow, circle+x) work on their own but fight with the markdown syntax, especially done `[x]` vs cancelled `[-]` (the icon for cancelled has an "x" while the markdown uses `-`). Design better icons that reinforce rather than contradict the underlying syntax.
- **Link to a specific section of a note** — `[[Note Title#Section]]` or similar. NotePlan may support this but it's unused. Explore later.
- **Drag and drop in sidebar** — Drag files into folders and folders into folders. Especially useful for tidying up the archive. Would need to update any wiki-links that reference moved notes.
- **Smarter note rename** — NotePlan keeps the old filename when you change a note's H1, then offers to update links. Could we rename the file too? Needs thought around backward compatibility. Someday-maybe.
- **Move note while keeping it open** — Currently you close a note, move it in the sidebar, then re-navigate. Being able to move it without closing would reduce mistakes.
- **Smarter backlinks** — NotePlan's backlinks panel is noisy (piles of "prep for [[link]]" entries from daily notes). Explore ways to make backlinks more useful: grouping, filtering, collapsing routine references, surfacing only meaningful ones.
- **Trashed note search** — Trashed notes should be searchable (for recovery) but never appear in autocomplete or link resolution.
- **@mention reference pane** — When viewing a person's note (e.g. `[[Angelica Bunyi, UX Designer]]`), show an optional reference pane at the top listing all tasks across all notes that mention `@AngelicaBunyi`. Since notes are written reverse-chron (newest at top), this puts unhandled tasks close to where they're needed. Should include: one-click to navigate to the source, option to filter out done tasks, and ideally no need to manually copy synced lines. The goal: "show me everything I need to talk to this person about" in one place, zero gymnastics.
- **@mention → note association** — Currently there's no way to associate an @mention with a specific note (e.g. link `@AngelicaBunyi` to `[[Angelica Bunyi, UX Designer]]`). If we could make this association, the reference pane becomes automatic. Explore how to establish and maintain this mapping.
- **Graceful mention deletion** — When an @mention is "deleted" (person leaves, becomes irrelevant), the text should degrade to plain text rather than being destroyed. Options: strip the `@` prefix, move to `@_old/` namespace, or just leave as-is but remove from the active mention index.
- **Proportional fonts for body text** — CM6 handles variable-width text fine. Use SF Pro / system sans-serif for body, a serif like New York for headings, monospace only for code. Match the NotePlan theme feel.
- **Use CM6 syntax tree instead of regex for live preview** — Current prototype uses regex to find markdown syntax. CM6 has a proper Lezer parse tree via `syntaxTree(state)`. Switching to tree-walking will be more robust and handle edge cases. Do this before adding more syntax support.
- **NotePlan theme reference** — Favorite theme is "JP Dieter Rams New York" at `~/Library/Containers/co.noteplan.NotePlan-setapp/.../Themes/JP Dieter Rams New York.json`. Key style choices: gold headings (#736B1E) in New York Semibold, red open tasks (#ED3F1C), faded syntax markers (#35000000), subtle tag/mention backgrounds (#20d87001), highlighted text (yellow bg), code in SF Mono with light gray bg. Also shows NotePlan's full style vocabulary (flagged states, working-on, schedule links, etc.) which hints at features we'll encounter.
